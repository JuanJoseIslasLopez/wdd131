      <h3>Traditional Arts</h3>
      <div class="content-with-images">
        <p>Japan is renowned for its traditional arts such as tea ceremony, ikebana (flower arranging), and calligraphy. The tea ceremony, known as "chanoyu," is a ritualistic preparation and presentation of matcha tea, emphasizing aesthetics, simplicity, and mindfulness. Ikebana, the art of flower arranging, focuses on harmony, balance, and minimalism, reflecting the beauty of nature in a disciplined form. Calligraphy, or "shodo," involves the artistic writing of Japanese characters, requiring precision, patience, and a deep connection to the written word.</p>
